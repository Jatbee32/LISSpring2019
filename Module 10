Description: The data set contains 16 samples of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons from 4 weeks and 9 weeks of age
            four replications at each age. The package will analyze the samples for total synapse number, dendrite complexity, and
            presence of ASD SHANK2 or SHANK2. Data visualization tools from programs such as ggplot2 can be utilized to assess the 
            correlation of hyperconnectivity and alterd transcriptome in SHANK2 neurons in ASD patients.
